# Data-Visualization-Capstone-project-Life-Expectancy-and-GDP
For this project, you will act as a data researcher for the World Health Organization. I will be helping them analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, I will analyze, prepare, and plot data, and seek to answer questions in a meaningful way.
